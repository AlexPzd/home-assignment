Notes from the Author:
1. I've based the structure of this tutorial on tutorial-type topics I've seen in the OpenPipeline guide. My document deals with a generalized procedure of data separation and processing in OpenPipeline.
2. I've included a Prerequisites section in the document to demonstrate that I think there should be such a section, but due to the limitations of the task, I don't have the full knowledge of what exactly the prerequisites for this procedure are.
3. In this particular instance, I've decided to use a table to describe pipeline configuration to avoid repetition and for the ease of adding new information about individual steps in the future.
